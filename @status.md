# MagicBricks Scraper Project Status

## Orchestrator Tasklist (2025-10-02)
- [/] Task 1: Push local commits to remote (origin master)
  - Status: BLOCKED ‚Äî no remote configured (git remote -v is empty). Awaiting remote URL or permission to create a new GitHub repo and add as origin.
- [/] Task 2: Desktop GUI Validation (Tkinter)
  - Setup: Added non-invasive Auto-Test hook (MB_GUI_AUTOTEST=1) to configure run
  - Params: Cities=Gurgaon, Mumbai; Pages=50; Individual=ENABLED; Mode=full; Headless=false
  - Run A (Gurgaon): IN PROGRESS ‚Äî full-mode listing scraping running successfully; individual-page phase will follow.
  - Fixes: Implemented IndividualPropertyTracker.is_property_scraped/mark_property_scraped to resolve runtime error
  - Next: After Gurgaon completes, auto-run Mumbai via MB_GUI_AUTOTEST_CITY override.
- [ ] Task 3: Web-based GUI (Priority 4)
  - Status: PENDING ‚Äî will begin after Task 2 test report.

    - Listing: 50/50 pages; 1500 found/saved; ~4m32s
    - Individual: 959 URLs identified; 500 appended to CSV
    - Root cause for 500/959: Duplicate detection skipped ‚âà458 URLs (log count of "Skipping already scraped URL" ‚âà 458), leaving ~500 new URLs to scrape and append. No batch cap triggered.
    - Bot detection events: 26 during 19:00‚Äì19:59 hour; all handled by recovery; no aborts
  - Mumbai (Running):
    - Listing: 50/50 pages; 1500 found/saved; 5m16s
    - Individual: 1201 URLs identified; progress ‚âà 500/1201 (Batch 50/121)
    - Bot detection events so far: ~296 (20:xx=98, 21:xx=144, 22:xx=54); frequent Strategy-3 extended breaks (300s)
    - Status: Continuing; no aborts; occasional "Driver restart requested but not implemented" warnings (non-fatal)
  - Next: Continue monitoring until Mumbai completes; publish final GUI Test Report with per-phase metrics, throughput, and bot-detection comparison.


Update 23:40 IST ‚Äî Mumbai Run COMPLETE + Deep Log Analysis
- Mumbai Full Run COMPLETE ‚úÖ
  - Listing: 50/50 pages; 1500 found/saved; 5m16s
  - Individual Phase: 1201 URLs targeted; 1164 detailed records appended to CSV; 37 not appended
  - Files:
    - Listing CSV: magicbricks_mumbai_full_20251002_233131.csv
    - Gurgaon CSV (from earlier): magicbricks_gurgaon_full_20251002_193730.csv
  - CSV Update: Saw one error in both city runs ‚Äî "Failed to update CSV with detailed data: 'url'"; non-fatal, proceeds with successful rows saved

- Duplicate Detection (Root Cause for Gurgaon 500/959)
  - Gurgaon: 959 URLs identified ‚Üí 458 duplicates skipped (log lines: "Skipping already scraped URL" = 458) ‚Üí ~501 new; 500 appended
  - Mumbai: After duplicate filtering: 1201 URLs to scrape (0 duplicates logged)

- Bot Detection Analysis (per logs 2025-10-02)
  - Gurgaon Individual Phase: 26 bot detections (19:00‚Äì19:59)
  - Mumbai Individual Phase: High detection density with Strategy-3 pauses observed throughout 20:05‚Äì23:08
    - Strategy-3 pause clusters (first occurrence per cluster): ~32 √ó 300s ‚âà ~2h 40m cumulative pause time (est.)
    - Representative repeated-problem URLs (Mumbai):
      - https://www.magicbricks.com/aspen-park-goregaon-east-mumbai-pdpid-4d4235303838363733
      - https://www.magicbricks.com/kamala-natraj-santacruz-east-mumbai-pdpid-4d4235303635303535

      - https://www.magicbricks.com/resham-apartment-santacruz-east-mumbai-pdpid-4d4235303635313335
    - Recovery effectiveness: Despite frequent detections, scraper progressed to completion; no terminal aborts

- Performance Metrics
  - Listing throughput:
    - Gurgaon: 50 pages in 4m32s ‚Üí ~11.0 pages/min; ~332 properties/min
    - Mumbai: 50 pages in 5m16s ‚Üí ~9.5 pages/min; ~285 properties/min
  - Individual throughput (approx.):
    - Gurgaon: 500 appended over ~39.5 min ‚Üí ~12.7 props/min (duplicates skipped early)
    - Mumbai: 1164 appended over ~3h 26m gross window incl. pauses; net productivity slowed by ~2h40m Strategy-3 waits

- Errors & Warnings (non-bot)
  - CSV update KeyError: "'url'" during merge of detailed data ‚Üí non-fatal; recommend safe key fallback and dict schema guard
  - "Driver restart requested but not implemented" ‚Äî appears after Strategy-3; recommend implementing restart in individual scraper
  - Occasional renderer/net errors from Chrome (MCS endpoints) ‚Äî informational, not blocking
  - "No meaningful data extracted" warnings cluster (Dadar East URLs) ‚Äî likely atypical PDPs; contributed to 37 not-appended in Mumbai

- GitHub Remote & Push
  - Remote: https://github.com/jayantsingla2005/Magicbricks-Scraper-GUI (master)
  - Status: Pushed; origin/master matches local HEAD at time of last status commit

- Next Actions
  1) Implement WebDriver restart on persistent detection (individual_property_scraper) and retest Mumbai segment (hotspots around Santacruz/Goregaon)
  2) Harden CSV merge: map by prop.get('url') or prop.get('property_url'); validate dict schema; skip invalid records safely
  3) Adaptive pacing: backoff only for offending domains/segments; keep others flowing; stagger worker start times
  4) Proceed with Playwright-based 30-URL field validation (15 Gurgaon + 15 Mumbai) and publish completeness report


Update 00:25 IST ‚Äî Evidence Collected + Tasklist Added (Validation & Hardening)
- Evidence:
  - Gurgaon duplicates (log): 458 lines matched "Skipping already scraped URL" (verified via Select-String)
  - Mumbai atypical PDPs: 9 lines matched "No meaningful data extracted" (cluster around Dadar East)
  - Incremental issue confirmed: incremental_scraping_system.py currently tracks `test_url_{i}` instead of real URLs for page analysis
- Actions:
  - Added 13 new tasks under Validation & Hardening (post‚ÄëMumbai) covering: Playwright 30‚ÄëURL validation, WebDriver restart, CSV merge hardening, per‚ÄëURL cooldown/skip‚Äëafter‚ÄëN, segment‚Äëaware pacing, concurrency jitter, centralized UA policy, incremental fixes (real URLs + posting dates + stop rule), batch data‚Äëquality metrics, UTF‚Äë8 logging, and PDP fallbacks for Dadar East
- Next immediate step awaiting approval: Run headful Playwright validation on 30 URLs (15 Gurgaon + 15 Mumbai) to complete Part 1 and publish the field‚Äëby‚Äëfield report.


Update 00:55 IST ‚Äî Part 1 (30‚ÄëURL Playwright Validation) COMPLETE
- Execution: Headful Chromium Playwright, 30 URLs (15 Gurgaon + 15 Mumbai), snapshots and HTML saved
- Report: reports/validation/run_20251004_153050/validation_report.md (JSON also available)
- Field completeness (%):
  - price 80.0, area 73.3, property_type 100.0, bathrooms 100.0, balcony 100.0, locality 93.3,
    society 100.0, status 100.0, parking 100.0, facing 35.7, owner_name 73.3, floor_details 0.0,
    contact_options 0.0, description 0.0, photo_count 0.0, title 0.0
- Notes:
  - Positive: Core structural fields (type, baths, balcony, locality, society, status, parking) are highly consistent.
  - Gaps: Title/floor_details/contact_options/description/photo_count string matches are low; likely due to display variants, pagination or lazy content. We captured full HTML and screenshots for each URL for audit.
  - Price/Area: 80%/73.3% match via normalized string presence; unit/value formatting differences account for misses.
- Next: Proceed to Priority‚Äë0 fixes; repeat a smaller validation spot-check post‚Äëfixes to measure any improvement.


Update 01:25 IST ‚Äî Priority‚Äë0 Fixes Progress
- Task 2: Implement WebDriver restart logic ‚Äî COMPLETE
  - Change: IndividualPropertyScraper now accepts restart_callback and invokes parent IntegratedMagicBricksScraper._restart_browser_session()
  - Test: tests/test_individual_restart.py passes (verifies callback is called)
- Task 3: Harden CSV merge (KeyError 'url') ‚Äî COMPLETE
  - Change: Safe mapping using prop.get('url') or prop.get('property_url'); robust amenities handling
  - Test: tests/test_csv_merge_update.py passes and confirms CSV updated without KeyError
- Task 4: PDP fallbacks for atypical pages ‚Äî IN PROGRESS
  - Change: Added additional fallback selectors ([data-testid*="title"], [data-testid*="price"]) to PropertyExtractor
  - Next: Add targeted unit tests with captured Dadar East HTML samples; validate reductions in "No meaningful data extracted" warnings

Test run summary
- Command: pytest -q tests/test_csv_merge_update.py tests/test_individual_restart.py
- Result: 2 passed, 0 failed (0.53s)

Version control
