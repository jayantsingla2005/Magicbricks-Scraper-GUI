- **Selector**: `.mb-srp__card` ‚úÖ (same selector works)
- **Cards Found**: 30 per page ‚úÖ
- **Extraction Compatibility**: Requires major field mapping changes

**Field Patterns**:
- **Area**: **"Plot Area"** (completely different label!)
- **Units**: "sqft" (900 sqft, 4521 sqft) - same units, different label
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NO STATUS FIELD** - uses "Transaction: Resale" instead
- **Society**: Some plots have society links (mixed)
- **Price**: Same format as other types ‚úÖ

**Plot-Specific Features**:
- **Dimensions**: "90 X 111", "75 X 12", "91.9 X 49.2" (Length √ó Breadth)
- **Open Sides**: "4", "1", "2" (number of open sides)
- **Road Width**: "27 m", "18 m", "10 m" (width of road facing plot)
- **Floor Construction**: "4" (floors allowed for construction)
- **Boundary**: "Yes", "No" (boundary wall presence)
- **Approval Status**: "Approved by HUDA", "Property in a Gated Locality"

## üîç Critical Insights for Robust Extraction

### ‚úÖ **Universal Patterns**
1. **Selector Consistency**: `.mb-srp__card` works across ALL property types
2. **Price Format**: Consistent "‚ÇπX Cr/Lac" format across all types
3. **Society Links**: `a[href*='pdpid']` pattern works where available
4. **Basic Structure**: Title (h2), price section, details section consistent

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Variations Requiring Updates**

#### **Area Field Labels**:
- **Apartments**: "Super Area" OR "Carpet Area"
- **Houses**: "Carpet Area" (primarily) OR "Super Area"  
- **Plots**: **"Plot Area"** (completely different!)

#### **Unit Variations**:
- **Primary**: "sqft" (most common across all types)
- **Houses**: Additional "sqyrd" (square yards) - "151 sqyrd"
- **Future**: Potentially "acres" for larger plots

#### **Status Field Availability**:
- **Apartments & Houses**: "Ready to Move", "Under Construction", etc.
- **Plots**: ‚ùå **NO STATUS FIELD** - different transaction model

#### **Society Data Availability**:
- **Apartments**: High availability (~60%)
- **Houses**: Mixed availability (some independent houses have no society)
- **Plots**: Mixed availability (depends on location/development)

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Area Extraction ‚ö°
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Immediate implementation needed

```python
# Enhanced area patterns to handle all property types
area_patterns = [
    r"Super Area[\s\S]*?(\d+[\s,]*(?:sqft|sq\.?\s*ft))",
    r"Carpet Area[\s\S]*?(\d+[\s,]*(?:sqft|sq\.?\s*ft|sqyrd|sq\.?\s*yard))",
    r"Plot Area[\s\S]*?(\d+[\s,]*(?:sqft|sq\.?\s*ft|sqyrd|sq\.?\s*yard|acres?))"
]
```

### Phase 2: Conditional Status Extraction ‚ö°
**Priority**: HIGH - Handle plots without status fields

```python
# Conditional status extraction based on property type
if "Plot" in title or "Land" in title:
    # Skip status extraction for plots
    status = "N/A - Plot/Land"
else:
    # Normal status extraction for apartments/houses
    status = extract_status_patterns()
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Unit Support ‚ö°
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Support sqyrd and future units

```python
# Enhanced unit patterns
unit_patterns = [
    r"(\d+[\s,]*sqft)",
    r"(\d+[\s,]*sqyrd)",
    r"(\d+[\s,]*sq\.?\s*yard)",
    r"(\d+[\s,]*acres?)"
]
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ Implement Enhanced Area Extraction** (Phase 1)
2. **‚úÖ Add Conditional Status Logic** (Phase 2)  
3. **‚úÖ Test Across All Property Types** (Validation)
4. **‚úÖ Performance Validation** (Large-scale testing)

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Deep Research is Essential**: Surface-level testing (60 properties) missed critical variations
2. **Property Type Diversity**: Each type has unique characteristics requiring specific handling
3. **Structural Consistency**: Core HTML structure remains consistent, enabling universal selectors
4. **Field Label Variations**: Critical to handle different field labels across property types
5. **Conditional Logic Necessity**: Some fields don't exist across all property types

**This comprehensive research validates the user's emphasis on deep analysis before implementation, preventing over-engineering while ensuring robust production coverage.**
